[What if We Were a Red Letter Church?](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/shanephipps/2019/03/03/what-if-we-were-a-red-letter-church/)



This article is my first post and gets at the heart of why I started this site.  Christ's words (you know the ones in the red letters in your bible) should be the foundation of the church.  We can argue every other word written in the context of history, geography, culture, etc but the red letters should be what we strive for.  It paints a much different picture than how the religious right and its leaders paint it.
