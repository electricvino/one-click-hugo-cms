  heading: What this is about
  text: >-
    I was tired of having my beliefs twisted and misrepresented by the
    evangelical community.  The current partnering of the GOP and Christians is
    contrary to the very teachings of Christ.  I know I am not alone in this
    belief and wanted a way to share my beliefs with others.
intro:
  heading: What we do
  text: >-
    I've created this site to share positive stories about those who I believe
    are following in Christ's steps and should serve as role models for others. 
    While I am going to call out the wolves dressed as lambs, I do want to try
    and stay positive with this experience and hope it becomes about community.

    In addition, this is going to be about my personal journey as I reconnect
    with my faith and express my beliefs through this writing.  I hope it
    connects with others and encourages a voice not represented by the
    "religious right".

    I want to share inspiring acts of others that I find.  I also will be trying
    to shine a light on current events and how Christ's teaching inform us about
    today's world.
